        title: 'Emotions',
        description: "What are emotions in psychology? An emotion is a complex psychological state triggered by stimuli. It is how one reacts to significant or impactful situations. A smiling face is interpreted to mean happiness; a crying one may very well signal sadness. Many cultures rely on recognizable facial expressions to tell how someone is feeling. Behind every emotion is a process that starts with a stimulus, initiates an internal reaction, and results in a visible expression. Emotions are instinctual, involuntary because they get triggered by specific events that are beyond human control. That’s why the way we respond also becomes involuntary. Our emotional experiences can alter our thoughts and perceptions that are associated with a particular event, so they influence behavior.",

        title: '3 key elements',
        description: "What are the key elements of emotions? Emotions are about how people deal with situations that they consider personally significant. Emotional experiences have 3 key elements – the subjective experience, the physiological response, and the behavioral response. Let’s take a look at each part. The subjective experience, also referred to as stimulus, is what triggers an emotion. It may be seeing or losing a loved one, getting married, getting a compliment, and so on. The subjective experience evokes different emotions in different people. However, it is the starting point of all emotions. Although basic emotions are expressed by people regardless of upbringing or culture, experiences that trigger them can be highly subjective.",

        title: 'Types of emotions',
        description: "The number of human emotions that exist is a subject that intrigues researchers and psychologists to date. What is apparent is that there are basic and complex emotions. The former developed as a survival mechanism in response to the ecological challenges faced by our remote ancestors, while the latter has evolved to meet today’s sociocultural expectations. Basic emotions like happiness or fear tend to happen automatically and are associated with certain facial expressions. They are wired into our brain, so they are innate, universal, fast, and automatic. Each basic emotion triggers a behavior with a high survival value. According to Robert Plutchik, professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, there are eight primary emotional dimensions. He developed a classification system known as the “wheel of emotions” that demonstrated how different emotions could occur concurrently. Psychologist Paul Eckman created a classification model to identify emotions that are universally experienced. The facial action coding system (FACS) evaluates the movements of the eyes, head, and facial muscles. Based on FACS, Ekman proposed that there are six basic emotions: Happiness, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Disgust, Surprise.",

        title: 'Basic emotions',
        description: "What are the 6 basic emotions? Although there are several theories of emotions in psychology, psychologist Paul Eckman’s facial action coding system (FACS) remains the most widely accepted. So let’s talk about 6 basic emotions that are universally experienced by people irrespective of their cultures. Happiness is more than the experience of a positive mood. It’s a pleasant emotion that is characterized by feelings of joy, contentment, satisfaction, gratification, and well-being. Happiness is about enjoying life and living it to the fullest. Many definitions of happiness exist under one of three categories: Short-term – your current experience, often triggered by temporary stimuli Medium-term – overall sense of well-being and feeling that your life is well-lived Long-term – a conscious approach to flourishing as a human being. Most human beings are engaged, consciously or unconsciously, in actions that will improve their happiness levels. Sometimes, these actions can have an opposite or short-lived effect. It’s why you might feel unsure of what to answer when asked, “Are you happy?”",

        title: 'Sadness',
        description: "Sadness can be defined as a temporary emotional state characterized by feelings of disinterest, hopelessness, grief, disappointment, and low mood. Although many believe sadness is a negative emotion, it plays a vital role in signaling one’s need for help or comfort. All people can experience this emotion from time to time, but if you feel sad for longer periods, it may be a sign of depression. The most reliable sign of sadness on the face is the angling of the inner corners of the eyebrows. Other facial changes include drooping upper eyelids, a lowered gaze, and downward lip corners. People can also express sadness through a dampened mood, crying, withdrawal from other people, or lethargy. Persistent sadness can be a sign of a mood disorder, so it requires assessment by an experienced mental health professional.",

        title: 'Fear',
        description: "Fear is triggered by a real or imagined threat or danger. Although it is considered a negative emotion, it serves a vital role by activating the fight-or-flight response and keeping us safe. The facial expression of fear can be confused with surprise. A person may raise their eyebrows, lift their upper lids, pull back the chin, and tense their lips. A high-pitched scream is a vocal expression of this emotion. Persistent, intense fear caused by anticipated threats or even our thoughts about potential dangers can be a sign of anxiety disorder. It is especially problematic if it interferes with basic life tasks and can only be diagnosed by a mental health professional.",

        title: 'Disgust',
        description: "Disgust is an emotion triggered by something unpleasant we see, smell, or taste. Scientists suggest that this emotion evolved as a reaction to harmful or fatal foods. Disgust response can be triggered by such things as blood, infection, poor hygiene, rot, and death. The most easily recognizable sign of disgust is the wrinkling of the nose. Raising the upper lip to the sneer is also a sign. Disgust can also be displayed by such physical reactions as retching or vomiting. People can also experience moral disgust when they see that others do something they consider immoral, distasteful, or evil. Disgust signals us to get away from or eliminate something offensive, toxic, or contaminating.",

        title: 'Anger',
        description: "Anger is a very powerful emotion that is characterized by feelings of agitation, hostility, antagonism towards other people, and frustration. It can be triggered due to stress, unmet needs, financial problems, family issues, etc. It may also be a part of our body’s flight or fight response and motivate us to protect ourselves and fend off danger. Common expressions of anger include: Pulled eyebrows, glaring eyes, tightly pressed lips, yelling or high tone of voice. Anger can be helpful when it is expressed constructively, and it can lead to actions that can help you find solutions to problems that are bothering you. However, if it is excessive or expressed in unhealthy ways, it can easily result in harmful behavior towards oneself and others. If anger is uncontrolled, it can turn into aggression, abuse, and violence.",
